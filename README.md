This repository contains code used to generate data presented in Lane Yutzy's dissertation.

For MOBO, the scripts provided were used for the PDMS MOBO approach to compile rheometry data.

For saMLDE_v2 aka GB2, the scripts were designed to be run with ESMFold, LightDock, and the ftMLDE packages, so scripts may reference code that is not present on this GitHub. Please see package-specific links for more information.

#### LightDock: https://github.com/lightdock/lightdock or https://lightdock.org
#### ftMLDE: https://github.com/fhalab/MLDE
