This repository contains all code used to generate data presented in Lane Yutzy's dissertation chapter titled "EVALUATING PREDICTED PROTEIN STRUCTURES IN DOCKING SIMULATION AS A HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING METHOD FOR DIRECTED EVOLUTION PROBLEMS".

For protein-protein docking simluation, the LightDock package was used (GitHub: https://github.com/lightdock/lightdock)(URL: https://lightdock.org).

For MLDE simulation, conda environments provided from ftMLDE (GitHub: https://github.com/fhalab/MLDE) were used to run all adapted code.
